| Method             | Focused capacity                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| human memory       | few kilobytes per second                   |
| long term memory   | few pieces per day                         |
| reading            | 1-20 words per second                      |
| sound              | few words per second (less than reading)   |
| graphics           | ~1-4Mpixel per second (for 1 frame/second) |
| automatic analysis | everything beyond that                     |

# Bug fixing

# Find the level:
* of hierarchy where bug occurs,
* component,
* type,
* define desired behaviour.

# Technical goals:
* minimize impact of bugs
* feedback loop time
* debug cycle

# Running the pipeline

* Size of the data
* Number of exceptions
* Debug cycle issues
* Division into stages
  - each stage stores all outputs to filesystem at the end
  - each stage can be replayed from previously stored data

1. Download metaserver alignments.
2. Download PDB structures.
3. Build single-template models.
4. Score and rank best single-template models.
5. Create best multi-template alignments.
6. Create variations of multi-template alignments.
7. Score and rank multi-template alignments.
8. Rank best multi-template models.
9. Send results

# Finding root causes

# Root cause analysis
* Primary vs secondary (fallout) exceptions
* Valid exceptions
* Importance of exceptions
  - statistical (number of occurences)
  - behavioural (qualitative change in result)

# Creating new tests
---
# Finding root causes - cycle

# Run cycle:
* Run on valid data set
* Identify problems
* Estimate problem impact
* Isolate most important problems
* Benchmarking change results (compare with previous run)

# Isolation - making self-contained unit tests
---
# Prioritizing problems

1. Report all problematic data ASAP:
```python
def function(input)
    assert goodData(input)
```
2. Gather exception reports from all logs:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "fib.py", line 9, in <module>
      raise NotImplementedError("error here")
      NotImplementedError: error here
```
3. Remember order of exceptions within each run.
  * Exception report
```python
(1, "Traceback ...", [resumption1, resumption2])
```
4. Compare tracebacks between runs:
  * usually enough to cut last line of traceback
5. Sort by order within each run, *and* frequency.
```bash
tracebacker.py *.log -o runReport.txt -t newTests.py
```
---
# Problem isolation from within long runs

* History of checkpointing
  - CRAY
  - MD and QM simulations
  - Core dumps
  - Perl dumps
  - Temporal debugging (e.g. like UndoDB)
* Checkpointing vs resumptions
  - define data formats for examination
  - minimal unit test isolation

```python
@resumable()
def myBuggyFunction(arg1, arg2):
        raise NotImplementedYet, "put code here..."
```
---
# Resumptions

# Resumption
  * allows to resume program fragment that crashed
  * call to a function with arguments from previous run
  * ideal unit test
  * should be reported for each exception
  * usually should pick innermost resumption

```python
def resumable(logger=print):
        "This function is resumable upon exception."
        def _wrapped(func, *args, **kwargs):
                 try:
                        func(*args, **kwargs)
                 except Exception:
                        printResumption(logger, func, args, kwargs)
                        raise
        return decorator(_wrapped)
```
---
# Resumptions

1. Save inputs
2. Identify call
3. Save exception
4. Resumptions as unit tests
5. Upgrade tracebacker.py to deal with resumptions

```python
def printResumption(func, args, kwargs, logger=print):
    "Prints a resumption: function call with all its arguments."
    code = func.__code__
    varDecls   = []
    formalArgs = []
    argNames = code.co_varnames[:code.co_argcount]
    namedArgs = (list(zip(code.co_varnames[:code.co_argcount], args)) +
             list(kwargs.items()))
    for (argName, argValue) in namedArgs:
            (varDecl, formalArg) = store(argValue, argName)
            varDecls.append(varDecl)
            formalArgs.append(formalArg)
    call = func.__qualname__ + "(" + ",".join(formalArgs) + ")"
    varDecls.append(call)
    logger("\n".join(varDecls))
```
---
# Example resumption

```python
def test_1():
    alpha = 'alphabetic, but not frenetic, crowdy, but not bawdy"
    beta  = readAlignment("input.fas")
    sampleFun(1, alpha, beta)
```
