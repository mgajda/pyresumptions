| Method             | Focused capacity                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| human memory       | few kilobytes per second                   |
| long term memory   | few pieces per day                         |
| reading            | 1-20 words per second                      |
| sound              | few words per second (less than reading)   |
| graphics           | ~1-4Mpixel per second (for 1 frame/second) |
| automatic analysis | everything beyond that                     |

# Bug fixing

# Find the level:
* of hierarchy where bug occurs,
* component,
* type,
* define desired behaviour.

# Technical goals:
* minimize impact of bugs
* feedback loop time
* debug cycle
---
# Running the pipeline

* Size of the data
* Number of exceptions
* Debug cycle issues
* Division into stages
---
# Finding root causes

# Root cause analysis
* Primary vs secondary (fallout) exceptions
* Valid exceptions
* Importance of exceptions
  - statistical (number of occurences)
  - behavioural (qualitative change in result)

---
# Finding root causes - cycle

# Run cycle:
* Run on valid data set
* Identify problems
* Estimate problem impact
* Isolate most important problems
* Benchmarking change results (compare with previous run)

# Isolation - making self-contained unit tests
---
# tracebacker.py

1. Gathering tests.
2. Assigning order of exceptions.
3. Classifying by number and order.
---
# Isolation using decorators

* History of checkpointing
  - CRAY
  - MD and QM simulations
  - Core dumps
  - Perl dumps
  - Temporal debugging (e.g. like UndoDB)
* Checkpointing vs resumptions
  - define data formats for examination
  - minimal unit test isolation

---
# Implementation

1. Save inputs
2. Identify call
3. Save exception
4. Resumptions as unit tests
5. Upgrade tracebacker.py to deal with resumptions

---
# Conclusion

# Strengths of Python:
* rapid development
* easy gluing
* metamodel for execution
* decorators
